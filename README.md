# Predict-Customer-Ratings-using-PySpark

Online shopping has become increasingly popular in recent years. Global e-commerce sales are expected to reach 6.3 trillion in 2023. This represents a growth of 10.4\% from 2022. The United States is expected to be the largest e-commerce market in 2023, with sales of 1.1 trillion dollars. This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including the convenience and affordability of online shopping, as well as the wide variety of products that are available online\cite{r7}.

### Problem Statement

One of the challenges of online shopping is that it can be difficult to know what products are worth buying. This is where customer feedback comes in. Customer feedback can provide valuable information about the quality of products, and it can help shoppers make informed decisions about what to buy.

One way to use customer feedback is to predict item ratings. This can be done by using a variety of machine learning techniques. However, one of the challenges of predicting item ratings is that it can be computationally expensive. This is because the number of possible combinations of products and ratings is very large.

In this project, we will use a parallelized approach to predict item ratings. This will allow us to reduce the computational cost of the prediction process. We believe that our approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of item rating predictions.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a parallelized approach to predict item ratings using customer feedback. This will be done by first performing sentiment analysis on the review text and then leveraging that to predict ratings for unseen reviews. The performance of the approach will be evaluated on the Multilingual Amazon Reviews Corpus, and the results will be compared to the results of other approaches.

### Key Benefits

\begin{itemize}
    \item NLP-based analysis of customer reviews enables data-driven decision-making by providing valuable insights into customer sentiment.
    \item Understanding customer feedback through NLP analysis of reviews, businesses can proactively address issues faced by customers.
    \item Improved product performance: Predicting customer ratings using reviews allows businesses to make informed decisions to improve their product or service.
\end{itemize}
